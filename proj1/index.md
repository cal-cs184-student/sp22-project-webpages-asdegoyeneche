### Task 4: Barycentric coordinates (10 pts)
**Solutions:** From our understanding, the barycentric coordinates of a certain point can be represented as a linear combination of reference points (a triangle for points in a plane).
More specifically, suppose we have some specified values (e.g., texture, coordinates) at the vertices of a triangle: `$(x_A,y_A);(x_B,y_B);(x_C,y_C)$`
